# iOS Production Case Studies

This repository serves as a high-level portfolio describing real-world iOS projects
I have worked on over the past **13+ years**.

Due to NDA and confidentiality constraints, source code cannot be shared publicly.
However, this document outlines the **context, responsibilities, technical challenges,
and learnings** from large-scale, production mobile applications.
I am happy to discuss technical details, architecture decisions, and trade-offs during interviews.

## Notes

This repository is intentionally documentation-only.
Its goal is to demonstrate **experience, technical maturity, and architectural thinking**
rather than provide sample code.

For any questions or deeper technical discussions, feel free to reach out.
